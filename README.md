# Social Media App - JavaScript 2 Course Assignment
## Overview
This project is an interactive social media application where users can perform typical CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on posts, register and log in, and manage their interactions through the app. The primary goal is to implement the app's functionality using JavaScript and work with a provided API, which handles authentication and post management. Styling and design are secondary in this phase.

## Description
The social media platform allows users to register, create posts, and manage content directly from their dashboard. The app is designed to showcase JavaScript's capabilities in interacting with an API and managing user sessions using JWT tokens.

## Features
* **User Registration**: New users can create an account.
* **User Login**: Registered users can log in and receive a JWT for authenticated API requests.
* **Create Posts**: Logged-in users can create new posts and share content.
* **Edit Posts**: Users can update their existing posts.
* **Delete Posts**: Users can remove their posts if needed.
* **Post Listing**: View a list of recent posts.
* **Single Post View**: View details for an individual post by its ID.
* **Logout Functionality**: Users can log out and clear their session token.

#### API Integration

* Register new users
* Login and JWT token management
* Create, edit, delete, and fetch posts
